This program calculates the order of a given string using the given jagged array 
  A \n
  B C \n
  D E F \n
  G H I J \n
  K \n
  L M \n
  N O P \n
  Q R S T \n
  U \n
  V W \n
  X Y Z \n
Now according to the given position of the given array we get the order of a particular character of input string using formula
  xPosition*yPosition
Then to find order of a String the formula is
  âˆ‘(position of character from right)^(order of the character)

For example order of the string "SRM" is 858
