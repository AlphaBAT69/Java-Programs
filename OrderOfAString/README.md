###This program calculates the order of a given string using the given jagged array 
```bash
  A
  B C
  D E F
  G H I J
  K
  L M
  N O P
  Q R S T
  U
  V W
  X Y Z
```
Now according to the given position of the given array we get the order of a particular character of input string using formula
```bash
  xPosition*yPosition
```
Then to find order of a String the formula is
```bash
  âˆ‘(position of character from right)^(order of the character)
```
For example order of the string "SRM" is 858
